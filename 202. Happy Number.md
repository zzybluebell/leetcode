# 202. Happy Number

**Easy**

### Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

### *A happy number* is a number defined by the following process:
* Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
* Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
* Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return `true` if n is a happy number, and `false` if not.

```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1


Input: n = 2
Output: false

```

### Hint:
1. using while loop get each digits to pow calculate
2. using hashmap to check wheather the value is in loop

```java

class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        return isReallyHappy(n, set);
        
    }
    
    public boolean isReallyHappy(int n, Set<Integer> set) {
        
        if (n == 1 || n == 0) return true;
        
        int temp= 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            temp += (int) Math.pow(n % 10, 2);
            n /= 10;
           
        }
        if (set.contains(temp)) return false;
        
        set.add(temp);

        return isReallyHappy(temp, set);
    }
    
}
```
