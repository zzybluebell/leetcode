# 740. Delete and Earn

**Medium**

**https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/**

### You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

  * Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
  
Return the `maximum number of points` you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.



```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.

### Hint :
1. DP 思想 类似于198. house robber 
2. 将每一个数的值和多少个count 存在 hashmap中
3. 将不重复的nums sort 进新的array
4. 用 `earnPre` 和 `earnPrePre` `前一个`和`前前一个` 的值
5. 分别比较`nums element`在是否相隔为1和 比大小后分别更新 `earnPrePre` `earnPre` 
```java

    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            map.put(nums[i], map.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0) + 1);
        }
        List<Integer> arrList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int n : map.keySet()) {
            arrList.add(n);
        }
        Integer[] newArr = arrList.toArray(new Integer[0]);
        Arrays.sort(newArr);
        int earnPrePre = newArr[0] * map.get(newArr[0] );
        int earnPre = newArr[1] - newArr[0] == 1 
            ? Math.max(newArr[1] * map.get(newArr[1]), earnPrePre) 
            : earnPrePre + newArr[1]* map.get(newArr[1]);
        
        for (int i = 2; i < newArr.length; i++) {
            int cur =  newArr[i];
            int curEarn = cur * map.get(cur);
            if (cur - newArr[i - 1] == 1) {
                if (curEarn + earnPrePre < earnPre) {
                    curEarn = earnPre;
                } else{
                    curEarn = earnPrePre + curEarn;
                }
            } else {
                curEarn = curEarn + earnPre;
                
            }
            
            earnPrePre = earnPre;
            earnPre = curEarn;
        }
        return earnPre;
    }
}
