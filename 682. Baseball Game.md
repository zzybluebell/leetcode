# 682. Baseball Game

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/baseball-game/

**Easy**

## Stack

### You are keeping score for a baseball game with strange rules. The game consists of several rounds, where the scores of past rounds may affect future rounds' scores.

### At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. You are given a list of strings `ops`, where `ops[i]` is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

1. An integer `x` - Record a new score of `x`.
2. `"+"` - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. It is guaranteed there will always be two previous scores.
3. `"D"` - Record a new score that is double the previous score. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.
4. `"C"` - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.

### Return the sum of all the scores on the record.

## Hint:
1. 用stack的思想
2. Integer.valueOf(op) 转化

```java


class Solution {
    public int calPoints(String[] ops) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack();
        
        for (String op : ops) {
            if (op.equals("+")) {
                int top = stack.pop();
                int newValue = top + stack.peek();
                stack.push(top);
                stack.push(newValue);
            } else if (op.equals("C")) {
                stack.pop();
            } else if (op.equals("D")) {
                stack.push(stack.peek()*2);
            } else {
                stack.push(Integer.valueOf(op));
            }
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int n: stack) ans += n;
        return ans;
    }
}

```
