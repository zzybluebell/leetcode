## Greddy

### You are given an array people where `people[i]` is the weight of the `ith` person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of `limit`. Each boat carries `at most two people` at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

### Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.

### Hint:
1. only can save at most 2 people
2. light weight person can pair with anyone.
3. but heaviest person if can not pair with lightest weight person, than he only can alone.
   
```java

class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        Arrays.sort(people);
        
        int i = 0, j = people.length - 1;
        int res = 0;
        
        while(i<=j) {
            res++;
            if (people[i] + people[j] <= limit) {
                i++;
            }
            j--;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
